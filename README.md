Using [Python 3.8.5](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-385/)

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

You will often see the following
```
import os
os.environ['TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL'] = '3'
```

This is used to quiet Tensorflow's many warning and info messages in the console so that it is easier to focus on the concepts at hand.
